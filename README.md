# exp-T-control-v2

Scripts for controlling heating devices and temperature sensors.

These programs were created during Vincent Funke's Bachelor's thesis (in German) "Resistive and inductive heating in a crystal growth furnace: automation using Python and measurements of electromagnetic parameters" (see [Documents](#Documents)). The [Model Experiments Group](https://www.ikz-berlin.de/en/research/materials-science/section-fundamental-description-1) at the Institute for Crystal Growth (IKZ) was supported in this work.

The programs are based on the predecessor model [exp-T-control](https://github.com/nemocrys/exp-T-control). The emulation with the Arduino and the use of Eurotherm are the changes to the predecessor model. In addition, improvements have been made to the programming of the main programs and device libraries.

The improved and extended programs can be found in the [Emissivity](https://github.com/nemocrys/exp-T-control-v2/tree/main/Emissivit%C3%A4t) folder. The folder [Emulation_Eurotherm](https://github.com/nemocrys/exp-T-control-v2/tree/main/Emulation_Eurotherm) describes the variant with the Arduino, which can either replace or assist the Eurotherm. Further descriptions and readmes can be found in the folders!

## Documents

Further information about the programs and their use, as well as information about the experiment, can be found in Vincent Funke's Bachelor's thesis (in German): "Resistive und induktive Heizung in einer Kristallz√ºchtungsanlage: Automatisierung mit Python und Vermessung der elektromagnetischen Parameter". It is available online [here](https://nemocrys.github.io/papers/Bachelorarbeit_Vincent_Funke_ohneUS_Logo.pdf).
